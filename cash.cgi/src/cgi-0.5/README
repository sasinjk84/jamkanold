 1. What is C CGI Library?

 It's a simple yet complete set of functions you need to create CGI modules.
If you believe it's not that simple or ain't complete, please let us know and
we'll fix it.

 2. Requirements

 At present stage development occurs on the fowllowing systems:

 - PC with Slackware Linux 7.0, kernel 2.2.14, glibc 2.1.2, gcc/egcs 1.1.2,
Apache 1.3.9, bash 2.03.0(1), Netscape Navigator 4.7, Lynx 2.8.2rel.1

 - PC with Linux 2.0.38, libc5, gcc 2.7.2.3, Apache 1.3.1, bash 1.14.7(1), w3m,
Netscape Navigator

 All the code is written with portability in mind. If something doesn't work
for you as expected, please let us know and send us stdout and stderr of the
configure script and make. We'll do all possible to fix it.

 3. Installation

 C CGI Library is shipped together with configure script and Makefile to adhere
GNU software distribution guidelines. Your normal way is

# ./configure
# make
# make -n install

 Check dirs and permissions, then

# make install

 For configure script and Makefile to work you need to have cp, rm, sed,
gcc, ld, ar and bash available.
 Read the bottom part of INSTALL to see how to tell configure about your
system.
 Anyway it should compile and run without problems on any POSIX compliant
system.

 4. Documentation

 See the file MANUAL for a full function descriptions and advices on creating
CGI programs using this library.

 5. Distribution

 C CGI Library is currently GPL'ed, see COPYING for details.

 6. Acknowledgements

 Programs used: 

  Linux, bash, Apache, w3m, Netscape, vim, autoconf, make, sed, gcc, ld, ar,
mcedit

 Thanks to developers of these and numerous other free and open source tools.

 10x and good luck creating great CGI programs! :^)
